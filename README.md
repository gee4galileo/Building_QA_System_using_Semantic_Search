# Building a Q&A System with Semantic Search

**Course Title:** [Understanding and Applying Text Embeddings with Vertex AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/google-cloud-vertex-ai/)

**Repository:** [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gee4galileo/Building_QA_System_using_Semantic_Search.git)

**Project Overview:**
In this project, we harnessed the power of text embeddings and Google Cloud's Vertex AI to construct an intelligent Question and Answering (Q&A) system. By combining semantic search with the text generation capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM), we created a robust and versatile tool for answering user queries.
